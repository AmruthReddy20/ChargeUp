# Choosing the Optimal Location for the Next Electric Vehicle Charging Station

This is a project I will be working on for the following weeks at Insight Data Science. The project aims to explore the question "Where should we allocate the next electric vehicle charger/charging station". 

Many potential electric vehicle (EV) buyers are frustrated by the fact that the current charging station network is still underdeveloped. The terminology "range anxiety" describes the situation where EV owners are worried about exhausting their EV battery in a trip. Currently, most EV owners have access to home charging, whereas home charging is almost impossible for those living in an apartment or a condo. Therefore, to push EV sales to the next stage, it is necessary to grow the charging network.

My plan to solve this problem is to: 
* Find out where do people commute to during the day? 
* Find out where do people reside so they will charge the EVs during the night? 
* Find out where are the charging station deserts.

An optimization problem needs to be solved that considers: 
* Extending the accessibility of the current charging network. (Cover the area that currently are under-deployed with charging stations.)
* Provide charging to places with the highest demand. This would include several specific situations: (1) overnight charging, (2) charging during day time, (3) fast charging along highways.
